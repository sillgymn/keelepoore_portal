# About

RNG is inspired by contributed Registration and Signup modules. Development
originally began early 2013, but has been reworked due to inactivity of the
original project, and unexpected extension of development timeline for Drupal 8.

See MAINTAINERS.txt for a list of official developers.

# Model

    ┌─ Event Type
    ├─ Registration Type(s)
    └─►Event ─┬─► Registration(s) ─┬─► Registrant(s) ─► Identity
              ├────────────────────┴─► Group(s)
              └─► Rule(s) ─┬─► Action(s)
                           └─► Condition(s)

A Registration is a content entity that associated with an Event entity, and 
maintains relationships to Identities via Registrant entities. Each Registrant
maintains a relationship between a Registration and an Identity. Registrant 
entities are content, and thus can hold meta information in fields describing 
how an Identity relates to a Registration.
